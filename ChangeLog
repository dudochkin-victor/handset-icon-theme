	* configure.ac (AC_INIT):

	  Bumped package version to 0.0.5.

	  Corrected package name.  Do not use tarball name in place of
	  package name.

	  use of a directory as an argument is a bit misleading.

	  (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE):

	  Make Bzip2 the default compression to use for dist tarballs.

	  (AC_CONFIG_FILES):

	  Added new 96x96 and 128x128 icon directory Makefiles.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS):

	  Added new 96x96 and 128x128 directories to the list of
	  subdirectories.

	* 32x32:
	* 48x48:

	  Integrated new handset icon set from our designer.  Notice the
	  new 96x96 and 128x128 set of icons.
